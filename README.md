## Introduction
This project focuses on implementing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset, a benchmark in machine learning, contains 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits, each 28x28 pixels in size. The goal of this project is to build and train a CNN model to accurately classify these images into their corresponding digit labels (0-9).

## Features
+ **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Load the MNIST dataset and preprocess it by normalizing the pixel values.
+ **Model Architecture**: Define a CNN architecture with layers optimized for feature extraction and classification.
+ **Training and Validation**: Train the model using the training dataset and validate its performance on the test dataset.
+ **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model’s accuracy and loss, and visualize the results.

## Data Loading and Preprocessing
+ **Fetching the Dataset**: The MNIST dataset is loaded from the UCI repository using the **'fetch_ucirepo'** function.
+ **Data Structure**: The data is split into features (images) and targets (labels).
+ **Data Splitting**: The dataset is divided into training and testing sets, maintaining the distribution of classes.

## Model Architecture
The CNN model is defined using Keras, with the following architecture:

+ **Input Layer**: Accepts 8x8 grayscale images.
+ **Convolutional Layer**: Applies convolution operations to extract features.
+ **Pooling Layer**: Reduces the spatial dimensions of the feature maps.
+ **Flatten Layer**: Flattens the pooled feature maps into a single vector.
+ **Fully Connected Layer**: Applies dense layers to perform classification.
+ **Output Layer**: Outputs the probability distribution over the 10 digit classes.

## Training and Evaluation
+ **One-Hot Encoding**: The target labels are converted to one-hot encoded vectors.
+ **Model Compilation**: The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function.
+ **Model Training**: The model is trained for 50 epochs with a batch size of 32, using the training data.
+ **Performance Monitoring**: The training process is monitored using validation data to track accuracy and loss.

## Results
The model achieves high accuracy on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in recognizing handwritten digits. Key performance metrics and visualizations of the results are provided to assess the model’s performance.
